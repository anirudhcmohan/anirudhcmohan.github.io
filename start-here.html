            My goal with this site is to share my ideas with you, get your feedback on them, and inspire you to share your ideas with me.
            <br><br>
            My day job is co-founder and general manager of <a href="https://www.gamesnacks.com" target="_blank">GameSnacks</a> at <a href="https://area120.google.com/" target="_blank">Area 120</a>. I work and play in San Francisco. I’m from Northern Virginia originally and think fondly of the east coast. I love stories, ideas, and sensory experiences.

            I’d love to meet potential project partners, co-workers, mentors, mentees, penpals, and friends. I enjoy people who are kind, playful, think for themselves, and optimistic.
