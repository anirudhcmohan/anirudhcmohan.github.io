      Welcome
    </h1>
    <p>
      I love building new software products. My <a target="_blank"
        href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/anirudhmohan/">current job</a> is leading a team in Google Labs
      building a new generative AI product in the code and app generation space. Previously I co-founded <a
        href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/23/area-120-is-beginning-to-use-googles-massive-reach-to-scale-html5-gamesnacks-platform/"
        target="_blank">GameSnacks</a>, a gaming platform acquired by Google.
      <br><br>
      I enjoy advising and investing in startups. I know gaming, media, and AI tools/infra well, but I'm fairly
      sector agnostic if I connect well with the founder (at the earliest stages, <a target="_blank"
        href="https://animohan.me/writings/team-market-product.html">people matter
        the most</a>). Once I invest, I love helping founders with
      management, conflict resolution, product strategy, user research, communications, and managing their psychology.
      <br><br>
      I currently live in New York City. Previously I lived in San Francisco, went to school in North Carolina,
      and grew up in Northern Virginia. I'm
      interested in health/wellness, novels, biographies, podcasts, films, live music, art, psychology, nature,
      spirituality,
      and travel.
