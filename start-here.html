            <br><br>
            My <a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/anirudhmohan/">main job</a> is co-founder and general manager of <a href="https://www.gamesnacks.com" target="_blank">GameSnacks</a> at Google's new business incubator, <a href="https://area120.google.com/" target="_blank">Area 120</a>. Before I was a product manager at Google on Chrome and Android. 
            <br><br>
            I advise and angel invest in startups. I focus on consumer startups in categories like creator tools, gaming, new media platforms, and products in emerging markets (e.g. India, Southeast Asia, and Africa). But, <a target="_blank" href="https://animohan.me/writings/team-market-product.html">great founders and teams matter more</a> than markets and products in the early days. Once I invest, I love helping founders with management, conflict resolution, product strategy, user research, communications, and managing their psychology. 
            <br><br>
            I spend most of my time in San Francisco. I love stories, films, music, and sensory experiences.
