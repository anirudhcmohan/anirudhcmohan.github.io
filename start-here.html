    Welcome

    I love building new software products. My <a target="_blank"
      href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/anirudhmohan/">current job</a> is leading a product team in Google Labs building
    new generative AI products across code generation, 3D, video, and music. Previously I co-founded <a
      href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/23/area-120-is-beginning-to-use-googles-massive-reach-to-scale-html5-gamesnacks-platform/"
      target="_blank">GameSnacks</a>, a gaming platform acquired by Google.
    <br><br>
    I enjoy advising and investing in startups. I know the most about gaming, media, and AI tools/infra, but I'm fairly
    sector agnostic if I connect well with the founder (at the earliest stages, <a target="_blank"
      href="https://animohan.me/writings/team-market-product.html">people matter
      the most</a>). Once I invest, I love helping founders with
    management, conflict resolution, product strategy, user research, communications, and managing their psychology.
    <br><br>
    I live in New York City. I spent many years living in San Francisco. I grew up in Northern
    Virginia. I'm interested in health/wellness, novels, biographies, films, live music, psychology, nature, and travel.
