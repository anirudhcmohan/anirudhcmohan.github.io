            Welcome.
        </h1>
        <p class="body-text" id="start-here-text">            
            I am a subpar engineer, mediocre (and enthusiastic!) designer, half decent investor, pretty good strategist, strong communicator, and a darn good listener.
            <br><br>
            I’m excited to become a writer and (one day) musician.
            <br><br>
            I’m figuring out how best to apply my skills towards fulfilling work. 
            <br><br>
            I’ve primarily been a product manager at Google, which I’ve enjoyed. 
            <br><br>
            I spend most of my time managing a team building GameSnacks at Area 120, Google’s new product incubator. GameSnacks is a lightning-fast web gaming platform primarily for emerging markets like India, Indonesia, and Nigeria. 
            <br><br>
            I love building new ways for people to interact with each other and experience emotions and think thoughts they hadn’t before.
            <br><br>
            My goal with this site is to share my ideas and creative projects with others.
            <br><br>
            My hope is to meet potential project partners, co-workers, mentors, mentees, penpals, and friends. 
            <br><br>
            I most enjoy people who are curious, think for themselves, are willing to change their minds, and don’t take things too seriously (especially not themselves!). I believe this describes everyone if they’re in the right state of mind.
            <br><br>
