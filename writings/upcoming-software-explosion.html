    The upcoming software explosion
  </h1>

  <p><i>May 3, 2023</i></p>
  <p>Creating software today is slow, expensive, and difficult. Only a limited number of people possess the skills to do
    so. As a result <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"
      href="https://skventures.substack.com/p/societys-technical-debt-and-softwares">there’s an undersupply of useful
      software in the world</a>, particularly software tailored to individual needs.</p>
  <p>Large language models are particularly good at writing code, likely due to its highly structured nature. Developers
    now routinely use LLM code completion tools like Copilot which <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"
      href="https://twitter.com/karpathy/status/1608895189078380544">generate up to 80% of the code they write</a>. Some
    people even <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"
      href="https://twitter.com/adamlyttleapps/status/1653603465757855744?s=42&amp;t=qwsR7J1htJWZLLMyvKPCrA">create
      full-fledged apps from mostly prompts</a> and lightweight debugging. We're fast approaching a point where apps and
    services can be created from a mere description, without any knowledge of coding.</p>
  <p>As software creation becomes more accessible, we’ll see an explosion in the amount of software in the world. There
    are 25 million software developers today but over 3 billion people online - that’s a 100-fold potential increase in
    the number of software creators. Photos and videos are ubiquitous ever since mobile phones put cameras in every
    pocket. LLMs will make new software ubiquitous too.</p>
  <p>In this new world, we should expect software to be cheap and plentiful. We'll constantly create new software to
    solve new problems or modify the software we use to adapt to our specific needs. We’ll all become developers in the
    way that we’ve all become photographers. We won't even reuse most of the software we make, just like we don't look
    at most of the photos we take.</p>
  <p>What will the software creation tools of the future look like? What new categories of apps will emerge once
    there are over a billion developers? Let me know via <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"
